## Overview

Some of the best experiences in homebrewing are the comradery and competition. Homebrewing communities have become a fellowship of like-minded folks who enjoy getting together over a quality, homemade craft beer. Getting constructive feedback on your beer from certified judges is also an integral part of the growth process of a homebrewer. Finding competitions where there will be certified judges and events that allow homebrew to be served is the problem that this application will solve.

This application is important to me because I see a need for it in the homebrewing community. Having served as Vice President for a local homebrew club, it was my task to keep the club up to date on all upcoming competitions and events. The current problem with completing this task is that all homebrewing events/competitions are currently spread out over many different platforms. It could take hours to consolidate all of the info and put that info into an easy to read format.


## Features

The Homebrewing Competition App will allow users to sign up with an authenticated profile in order to create and update events/competitions as they are announced. This will generate a consolidated calendar of events/competitions for homebrewers in this regional area and will crowd source the collection of data.

Users will also be able to sort events by date, location, and by category (whether it is a serving event or a mail in competition). A stretch goal for the project will be to add a sharing feature that will allow users to share an event with friends via email and social media.
